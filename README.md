## Introduction

We can classify customer satisfaction as a performance indicator that shows how well a company is able to meet consumer expectations before, during, and after a purchase.

When it is high, this metric signals compatibility between what the company offers and what the customer needs. It is a good gauge to understand if the provided service and created experience make sense for the target audience.

On the other hand, if customer satisfaction is low, it means that the consumer's expectations were not met â€“ whether it's related to the service, product, or purchased service. And this can greatly harm your brand reputation.

In this project, the customer satisfaction dataset extracted from Kaggle will be analyzed, and the following phases will be implemented: <br>

    1) Data import, 
    2) Data analysis, 
    3) Data transformation, 
    4) Loading of processed data, 
    5) Machine learning model training, 
    6) Model testing, and
    7) Model implementation.
